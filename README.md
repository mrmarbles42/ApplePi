# **ApplePi sensor project**

================================================

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a sensor network that is capable of identifying and monitoring agricultural pathogen conditions for IPM activities and research.

## Features

1. Ease of implementation and modification
2. Minimal costs related to extension and implementation

## How to use

## Technologies
Many of the components involved in this project are developed and distributed by Adafruit! I chose Adafruit because of their good-quality, (mostly) easy to use, and well documented tech. All of these aspects of thier products make it much easier to implement and modify the platform effectively.
